# Platform Adapters Playbook

Use this to adapt the design system to specific frontend surfaces.

## Web

Check:

- semantic HTML;
- responsive layout;
- keyboard path;
- visible focus;
- reduced motion;
- media loading;
- SEO/content structure when public pages matter.

Use browser inspection for overflow, text clipping, and asset rendering.

## Mobile H5

Prioritize:

- short task paths;
- thumb reach;
- sticky action only when helpful;
- compact navigation;
- reduced image weight;
- touch feedback;
- viewport-safe layout.

Avoid:

- desktop sidebars;
- hover-only interactions;
- tiny controls;
- long scroll storytelling for transactional tasks.

## WeChat Mini Program Style

Prioritize:

- familiar list/detail flows;
- shallow navigation;
- concise Chinese-facing copy when applicable;
- loading and unavailable states;
- 44px or larger touch targets;
- platform-like controls.

Avoid:

- PC landing layouts;
- heavy scroll animation;
- hidden primary action;
- dense decoration behind Chinese text.

## Dashboard / Operational Console

Prioritize:

- scan speed;
- abnormal state visibility;
- stable layout;
- compact repeated controls;
- table/list/map/timeline patterns;
- filters and time windows.

Avoid:

- marketing hero sections;
- decorative charts;
- overly expressive typography;
- status conveyed by color only.

## Game / Interactive Toy UI

Prioritize:

- readable game state;
- input controls;
- score/progress/lives;
- restart/pause/settings;
- feedback timing;
- canvas or playfield framing.

Avoid:

- UI elements covering gameplay;
- ambiguous controls;
- animation that hides hit feedback;
- fixed desktop-only play area.

## Responsive Checklist

- Use media/container queries, `clamp()`, `minmax()`, or framework breakpoints.
- Avoid uncontrolled `100vw` layouts that cause horizontal scrolling.
- Avoid fixed widths that exceed common mobile viewports.
- Test long labels and dynamic content.
- Keep layout stable during loading and hover/focus changes.
